[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)'s mission is to help scientists and engineers get 
more research done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic skills for scientific computing. 
This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including using the command-line, building and 
designing programs in Python, and managing the development of code with version control in Git. 
Participants will be encouraged to help one another.
